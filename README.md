# Social Network API: Mongoose & MongoDB


## Introduction
This API allows users to create and manage users, create thoughts, and add reactions to thoughts in a social network application. It is built using Mongoose and MongoDB, and implements CRUD operations.

## Description
The primary goal of this API is to demonstrate my proficiency in utilizing Mongoose and MongoDB to develop a backend API for a social network application. It leverages Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, and Moment.js for timestamp functionality.

Throughout the development process, I have improved my skills in integrating Mongoose models with MongoDB and have gained more experience in working with controllers and routes.
